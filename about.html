<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a passionate guy that love to challenge myself and learn new skills. I am currently 
  from New Orlenas, La, but I moved to Dallas, TX in 2021 to pursue my dreams.</p>

<p>I am currently a director of film and technical director. I would like to learn more 
  than just film so I challenge myself to learn web development. I would like to learn 
  this in order to have a other skill set that could make me useful in the marketplace.
</p>

<p>Web development can help me create another avenue of income in order that I can own
  a parking garage one day.
